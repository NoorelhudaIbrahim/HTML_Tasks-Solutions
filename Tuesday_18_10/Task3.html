    <p>ack Beckman, the 50-year-old driver of Terry Chandler’s Infinite Hero Dodge Charger R/T Funny Car for Don Schumacher Racing, began to pursue his drag racing passion in 1998 when he became a driving instructor for Frank Hawley’s NHRA Drag Racing School and went on to help more than 7,000 students earn their NHRA competition racing licenses.
 
        He made his debut as a part-time Top Fuel dragster driver in 2005 after a winning battle against non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
         
        The California native who lives in Norco, Calif., with his wife Jenna and two children, joined DSR in 2006 and won the 2012 NHRA Funny Car world championship, nine years after he became the Super Comp world champion in NHRA Sportsman competition.</p>
